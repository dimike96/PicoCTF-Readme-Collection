# Basic File Exploit

In this challenge we are given access to a program that allows you to write files and read them, and asked to try to break it!

We have a netcat connection (```nc saturn.picoctf.net 49698```) and the source code (without a flag) to work with.

## Solution

The program takes a number to determine whether we will be writing, reading, or exiting. 

If we're writing it has us enter the data followed by the length of that data, then produces an id number to read our file later.

Sometimes we can find issues where specific data types are requested, but not neccesarily checked for...

The initial stage checks, the length value is checked, but the id number is not.

If we enter "flag" (or any string) instead of a number we get the flag!
