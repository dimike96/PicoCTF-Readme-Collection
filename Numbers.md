# The Numbers
The numbers... what do they mean?

The challenge provided a picture that contained a set of numbers.

## Solution

The numbers simply corredspond to their index of the alphabet.

I transcribed the numbers from the image into a string, then list, to feed a python program

num_cruncher.py takes that string and converts it to the flag.
