This challenge gives us a svg file and we need to get our flag from it

## Solution

What I tried first was opening the file up in my default svg application, in my case inkscape, and poke around

Just trying to click around to maybe find layers/objects I could manipulate even if I couldn't see them found me something in the dead center of the image

Massively blowing up the scale to zoom in on it is one method to getting the flag

Additionally, if we just open the svg in a text editor (I used VS Code because I use it for most things) we can see the flag directly in the file which seems like a much easier approach

Anyways, these both retrieve the flag!
