# Convertme.py

This challenge provided a python script that asks you to do a quick conversion from decimal to binary.

## Solution

You can use local or web based tools to do the conversion
Google is what I used to save time.

I was asked to convert '66' which is '0b1000010'

I do not fully understand the script and likely there is a way to get the flag without playing its game. For another day perhaps...

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{4ll_y0ur_b4535_c1aa6329}
```
