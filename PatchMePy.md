# Patchme.py 

This challenege gives us a python script and an ecoded flag file

## Solution

All we need to do is change the line in the script where it checks the user input against the correct password.

```
if user_pw == "lol":
```

For example, you can set it to whatever you like, or remove/restructure the function in anyway that gets you the flag

```
picoCTF{p47ch1ng_l1f3_h4ck_f01eabfa}
```
